There once was a little dog named Taco. Taco's favorite snacks were Oreos. One day someone offered Taco 500 oreos to help him finish his summer break homework, but Taco just ended up tearing everything apart. When this guy went back to school, his teacher questioned him about his missing homework, ...
The guy just said that Taco was a professor who saw the homework and was so taken aback by
how dumb it was, that he destroyed it in order to save the guy. The teacher then realized 
their mistake and ..
they decided to cancel the summer break homework from now on. And Taco became a hero of the students. His statue was set in front of the school for memorization.
Taco would forever be famous to the school children and his tale would live 
on for generations. Long live paco!
